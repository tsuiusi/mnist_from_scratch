# Writing an MLP for MNIST from scratch

I have 3 model.py's in this repo:
1. model.py: the true model, written by me in numpy. it's kinda dumb, but it looks like it trains, so i'm happy with it for now. will optimize later.
2. model2.py: written in mlx. I used the classes as reference for how I wrote my classes in model.py
3. model3.py: stolen from samson zhang on youtube. was one of the first few videos i watched, he explained it well, i used the data handling part as reference for how i did it. (i did do the linear algebra for all the passes and backprop and data manipulation by hand though)
